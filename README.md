# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a Streamlit web application written in Python for predicting diabetes based on user input. The application allows users to input various health parameters, such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., and provides predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## About

This project is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The machine learning model used for prediction is trained on a dataset containing health parameters of individuals, including whether they have diabetes or not. The model is trained to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on their health parameters.
